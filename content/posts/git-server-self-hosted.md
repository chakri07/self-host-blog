title: "Self-Hosting Gitea: Two Years In"
date: 2026-02-05T11:00:00-05:00
summary: "Two years of running my own Gitea instance instead of pushing everything to GitHub. The migration took an afternoon. The maintenance is basically zero. And having a private mirror of every repo I care about is the kind of peace of mind that's hard to put a price on."

Two years of running my own Gitea instance. Migration took one afternoon. Maintenance since then: basically zero.

Private mirror of every repo I care about. Highly recommend.
